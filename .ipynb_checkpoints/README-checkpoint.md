# Group 201 - {The Taste of Wine}

- Your title can change over time.

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{My topic for this project is on wine quality, essentially what factors have an influence in making wine taste good. My data was obtained using physicochemical tests on red and white wine Vinho Verde samples, this means dataset contains components such as pH or acidity levels. The wine comes from a region in north Portugal called Vinho Verde, the data was provided by Viticulture Commission of the Vinho Verde Region (CVRVV) and a group of researchers. The dataset along with a paper was published in 2009 by a group of researchers, it does not say what year the data was obtained I guess it may have been a year or a couple of years before they published the paper. This data was of interest to me due to there being numerous wineries in the region I reside, so it would fun to learn about what’s behind the taste of wine.}
## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{My goal of this project is to analyze each physicochemical factor in how it influences the taste of wine, also compare these factors to see which ones have a strong impact on the taste as well. This topic is interesting to me because of the region I live in is known for their wine in Canada also my family is in the vineyard business and have worked at wineries as well. Looking at the dataset I am interested to know how the elements for instance pH or the different types of acidity such as fixed, citric and volatile can impact the taste of wine. I’m also curious to see if the amount of alcohol in the wine any effect on the quality of wine has; additionally, I know beforehand that residual sugar impacts the sweetness so I'm wondering how it will be related as well. I can see the dashboard being a great tool for helping in simplifying data also providing key information for the wine dataset.}
